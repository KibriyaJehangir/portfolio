# The Future of Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is one of the most exciting technological frontiers. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use **qubits**, which can exist in multiple states at once due to superposition. This property, combined with entanglement, gives quantum computers exponential power for certain problems.

## 🧑‍🔬 How Does it Work?

Quantum computers use **quantum gates** to manipulate qubits. These gates perform operations that classical bits cannot. For example, a **Hadamard gate** puts a qubit into superposition.

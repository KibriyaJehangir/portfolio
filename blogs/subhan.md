# My Journey Into Programming and Technology

Technology has always fascinated me, and from a very young age, I found myself drawn to programming. Over the years, Iâ€™ve explored different programming languages, tools, and platforms, gradually building my skills and understanding of the digital world.

## Early Interest in Coding

I started programming at the age of nine. What began as curiosity soon turned into a passion. I experimented with simple games and small apps, learning concepts like variables, loops, and logic in a hands-on way. This early exposure helped me develop problem-solving skills and a love for logical thinking.

### First Projects

Some of my earliest projects included:

- A **Tic-Tac-Toe game** in C, where I learned to create a simple AI opponent.
- Small apps using **Android Studio** and **Flutter**, experimenting with user interfaces and interactivity.
- Python scripts that automated daily tasks and solved small challenges.

These projects taught me the importance of practice, patience, and debugging.

## Exploring Web Development

As I grew older, I became interested in web development. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating simple websites and experimenting with interactivity. One of my favorite projects was **Type50**, a typing speed test app built using only front-end technologies. It allowed me to combine logic, design, and usability in a single project.

### Hosting and Blogs

I also began sharing my work online. Platforms like GitHub and GitHub Pages became my personal portfolio space, where I uploaded projects and blogs. I experimented with automating blog posting and integrating AI features to make my site interactive.

## Learning Advanced Technologies

In addition to web development, I explored:

- **Quantum computing** concepts, which gave me a glimpse of the future of technology.
- **Blockchain technology**, understanding how decentralized systems work.
- Creating my own **AI-powered projects** like automated Tic-Tac-Toe and blog posting tools.

These experiences helped me expand my knowledge and think about the practical applications of modern technology.

## My Vision for the Future

Looking forward, I aim to:

- Build my own software and tools that can help others learn programming.
- Explore cybersecurity internships to understand and improve digital safety.
- Grow my online presence, share tutorials, and inspire other young programmers.

I believe that learning, experimentation, and sharing knowledge are key steps toward success. Technology is constantly evolving, and I want to be a part of that evolution, contributing in meaningful ways.
